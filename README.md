This is all about Vegan/Vegetarian restaurants all over the United States. 

When you’re planning a night out, it can be hard to find vegan or vegetarian restaurants that cater to your diet.But in some states/cities ,it’s easier than others.

We wanted to figure out which states are having most vegetarian restaurants. so we turned to our data. At Datafiniti, we have datasets on everything from hotel occupancy to pricing for designer brands. 

For this analysis, we used a dataset from our Business Database of more than 18,000 U.S. restaurants that either self-identify as offering vegetarian or vegan cuisine, or which have “vegetarian” or “vegan” in their names.

This Pie-Chart shows the total vegetarian/vegan restaurants by state. Analysis shows California is having most Vegetarian restaurants , followed by New York state.
